## Video Streaming App Challenge

A basic youtube video streaming application, this appp allows the user to add youtube videos to playlist and play them according to how they were added. Not only that, the application also allow the user to re-arrange the order of the list by siply dragging the item to the desired posisition. When there is no current video playing, the user can simply drag any video from any position into the video player container to start playing the video or simply click the next button to play next video on the queue. However the player automatacally picks the next video on the queue after the current video has ended.
